VIP CLI is your tool for interacting with and managing your VIP Go applications.

## Getting started

First, install the package:

```
npm install -g @automattic/vip
```

Then, launch the command and follow the prompts:

```
vip
```

If you need more information, check out our [VIP CLI documentation](https://vip.wordpress.com/documentation/vip-go/vip-cli/).

## Changelog

### 1.1.0

- We now correctly report errors when `vip sync` fails. Previously, this would incorrectly report that a sync was run previously.
- We fixed permissions issues for some users with `admin` access for repos. They were unable to properly view and access applications.
- We now display more applications in `vip app list` (up to 100!) and have made it easier to browse through a large list thanks to (`$PAGER`|`less`) support. Previously you would only see the first 10 applications in your account.

### 1.0.0

The first release!

- `vip app list`: view a list of all your applications.
- `vip app`: view details about one of your applications.
- `vip sync`: trigger [a data sync](https://vip.wordpress.com/2018/03/28/data-sync-on-vip-go/) to synchronize data from your production environment to non-production environments.
