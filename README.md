VIP-CLI is your tool for interacting with and managing your VIP applications.

## Getting started

First, install the package:

```
npm install -g @automattic/vip
```

Then, launch the command and follow the prompts:

```
vip
```

If you need more information, check out our [VIP CLI documentation](https://vip.wordpress.com/documentation/vip-go/vip-cli/).

## Analytics

By default, we record information about the usage of this tool using an in-house analytics sytem. If you would prefer to opt-out of this data collection, you can do so via the `DO_NOT_TRACK` environment variable. You may either export it in your shell configuration or specify it on the command line (e.g. `DO_NOT_TRACK=1 vip app list`).
