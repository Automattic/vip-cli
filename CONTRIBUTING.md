# Contributing

Thanks for contributing to the VIP Javascript library. There are some guidelines to ensure we have consistency across the CLI and web interfaces.

## Adding commands

* New command names should use the singular case (e.g. site vs sites)

## Adding libraries

New libraries should generally support both CLI and web contexts, though some cases that won't make sense (e.g. formatting for CLI output). Ensuring the libraries are useful everywhere will allow us to offer consistent experiences regardless of the interface.
