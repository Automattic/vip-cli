# Contributing

Thanks for contributing to the VIP-CLI. There are some guidelines to ensure we have consistency across the CLI and web interfaces.

## Coding Standards

The VIP-CLI uses [`eslint-config-wpvip`](https://github.com/Automattic/eslint-config-wpvip) for coding standards.

Tests are powered by [Jest](https://jestjs.io).

## Developing

### Node version

To develop use the minimum supported node version. You can take a look in the `package.json` `engines` configuration
or, if you use tools like `nvm` you can run `nvm use` to ensure you're running the right one.

### Local Dev

To test against a local instance of Parker, you can use the `API_HOST` env var. You'll also want to nullify the `VIP_PROXY` env var as well.

Examples:

```
VIP_PROXY="" API_HOST=http://localhost:4000 node ./dist/bin/vip

VIP_PROXY="" API_HOST=http://localhost:4000 node ./dist/bin/vip app

VIP_PROXY="" API_HOST=http://localhost:4000 node ./dist/bin/vip -- wp option get home
```

### Using debugger

Who doesn't like a good console.log for debugging?
Well, sometimes it's insufficient, luckily it's not too complicated to use a debugger.

1. First, make sure to run the `npm run build:watch`, this will generate source maps
2. Run the command you want via `node --inspect`, like so: `node --inspect ./dist/bin/vip-dev-env-import-sql.js`
3. Note the port the debugger is listening on:

```
Debugger listening on ws://127.0.0.1:9229/db6c03e9-2585-4a08-a1c6-1fee0295c9ff
For help, see: https://nodejs.org/en/docs/inspector
```

4. In your editor of choice attach to the debugger. For VSCode: Hit 'Run and Debug' panel, hit the "gear" icon (open launch.json), make your `Attach` configuration entry to look like so:
   Make sure the `port` matches the port from step 3, and the `runtimeExecutable` matches the exact `node` executable you ran. If you use a version manager like `nvm`, its especially important to check this.

```json
{
	"name": "Attach",
	"port": 9229,
	"request": "attach",
	"skipFiles": [ "<node_internals>/**" ],
	"type": "node",
	"runtimeExecutable": "/Users/user/.nvm/versions/node/v14.18.2/bin/node"
}
```

5. Set your breakpoints and whatnot, hit the play button.
6. Confirm that you attached the debugger to continue command execution
7. Squash them bugs 🐛🔨.
8. [Optional but recommended] Pay it forward and implement a similar approach to other internal/external tooling.

### Adding commands

- New command names should use the singular form (e.g. site vs sites).
- Add new commands to `package.json#bin`.
- Run `npm link` so that `arg` knows how to spawn the command locally. (Skipping this step will result in `Error: spawn vip-command ENOENT`.)

### Adding libraries

New libraries should generally support both CLI and web contexts, though some cases that won't make sense (e.g. formatting for CLI output). Ensuring the libraries are useful everywhere will allow us to offer consistent experiences regardless of the interface.

## Release & Deployment Process

Our release flow for VIP CLI follows this pattern:

**_feature branch -> develop branch -> trunk branch -> NPM release_**

- For feature branches, please follow A8C branch naming conventions (e.g.- `add/data-sync-command`, `fix/subsite-launch-command`, etc.)
- Include a Changelog for all npm version releases, including any minor or major versions
- This is a public repository. Please do not include any internal links in PRs, changelogs, testing instructions, etc.
- Merge changes from your feature branch to the `develop` branch
- If you are ready to release your changes publicly, merge your changes from the `develop` branch to the `trunk` branch. All changes that are not ready to be public should be feature flagged or stay in the `develop` branch to avoid conflicts when releasing urgent fixes (not recommended).
- Finally, release your changes as a new minor or major NPM version. Ping in the #vip-platform channel to notify folks of a new release, but please feel free to release your changes without any blockers from the team. Any team member that is part of the Automattic NPM organization can release a new version; if you aren't a member, generic credentials are available in the Secret Store.

### Changelogs

Changelogs allow customers to keep up with all the changes happening across our VIP Platform. Changelogs for VIP CLI are posted to the [VIP Cloud Changelog P2](https://wpvipchangelog.wordpress.com/), along with the repository’s `README.md`.

## Releasing / Publishing

### Pre-publish Checks

We use a custom pre-publish [script](https://github.com/Automattic/vip/blob/trunk/hellpers/prepublishOnly.js) that performs some confidence checks to avoid common mistakes.

Further checks can be added to this flow as needed.

### Pre-publish Tasks

As part of the publish flow, we run the `prepareConfig:publish` task on `prepack`. This copies over "production" config values to your working copy to make sure the release includes those instead of development values.

We use `prepack` because:

- `prepareConfig:local` runs on `npm build` and we want to make sure those values are overriden.
- This is the latest npm event that we can run on before publishing. (Note: we tried `prepublishOnly` but files added during that step [don't get included in the build](https://github.com/Automattic/vip/commit/c7dabe1b0f73ec9e6e8c05ccff0c41281e4cd5e8)).

### New Releases

Prepare the release by making sure that:

1. All relevant PRs have been merged.
1. The release has been tested across macOS, Windows, and Linux.
1. The [changelog](https://github.com/Automattic/vip/blob/trunk/CHANGELOG.md) has been updated on `trunk`.
1. All tests pass and your working directory is clean (we have pre-publish checks to catch this, just-in-case).

#### Changelog Generator Hint:

```
export LAST_RELEASE_DATE=2021-08-25T13:40:00+02
gh pr list --search "is:merged sort:updated-desc closed:>$LAST_RELEASE_DATE" | sed -e 's/\s\+\S\+\tMERGED.*$//' -e 's/^/- #/'
```

Then, let's publish:

1. Make sure trunk branch is up to date `git pull`
1. Set the version (via `npm version minor` or `npm version major` or `npm version patch`)
1. For most regular releases, this will be `npm version minor`.
1. Push the tag to GitHub (`git push --tags`)
1. Push the trunk branch `git push`
1. Make sure you're part of the Automattic organization in npm
1. Publish the release to npm (`npm publish --access public`) the script will do some extra checks (node version, branch, etc) to ensure everything is correct. If all looks good, the new version will be published and you can proceed.
1. Edit [the release on GitHub](https://github.com/Automattic/vip/releases) to include a description of the changes and publish (this can just copy the details from the changelog).
1. Push `trunk` changes (mostly the version bump) to `develop` (`git checkout develop && git merge trunk` )

Once released, it's worth running `npm i -g @automattic/vip` to install / upgrade the released version to make sure everything looks good.

### Test Releases

Sometimes, we want to release a version we can test before releasing it to the public. In order to that, we need to release it under a tag other than `latest`, usually `next`. By default, `npm` install from the `latest` tag, so if `@next` isn't specified explicitely in the installation command like `npm install @automattic/vip@next`, a user will not get this version.

In order to do that, please follow this:

1. Manually change the version in `package.json` and `package-lock.json` to a dev version. Example: `1.4.0-dev1`
1. Run `npm publish --tag next` (When `--tag` is specified, we bypass the usual branch protection that doesn't allow you to publish form a brunch other than `trunk`).

You can repeat this with every new version until you're happy with your version and ready to a public release. We currently don't support multiple branches for multiple versions. When it's the case, this process needs to be done for every version in every branch.

_PS: The above steps will only change your local `trunk`. The remote `trunk` will remain unaffected, and you can reset your local trunk afterwards with `git reset --hard origin/trunk`._

### Patching Old Releases

There may be times when we need to push out a critical fix to the most recent release (or several past releases) such as for patching security issues or major bugs. This can be complicated by the fact that we may have some larger changes already merged into the `trunk` branch.

For these cases:

1. `git checkout` to the tag of the previous release.
1. Apply the fix (either manually or by cherry-picking).
1. Follow the release steps outlined above (as a `patch` release).

Then, repeat for any additional versions that we need to patch.

### go-search-replace binaries

Some unit tests require some go-search-replace executable binary files to run. Binaries files for several OS architectures can be downloaded from https://github.com/Automattic/go-search-replace/releases/

If, for some reason, you need to compile these binaries yourself, please follow instructions at https://github.com/Automattic/go-search-replace
